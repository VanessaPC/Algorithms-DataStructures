# Heaps

## Summary

A type of tree.

In a heap tree the parents are always the maximun or minimun value than the children. So in a max-heap the parents are always the biggest values, and in a min heap the parents are always the smaller values.

Time value:

- best case O(n)
- worst case O(n/2)

## Heapify

Heapify is re shuffling the tree so that it keeps the structure of a heap tree, where the parent nodes are bigger or smaller than the children.
